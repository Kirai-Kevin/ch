# Chatbot Deployment with Flask and Hugging Face API

This project implements a chatbot using Flask for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. It uses the Hugging Face Inference API to generate responses, providing a free and flexible chatbot experience.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-deployment.git
   cd chatbot-deployment
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install flask python-dotenv requests
   ```

4. Set up your Hugging Face API token:
   - Sign up for an account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) if you haven't already
   - Obtain your API token from the Hugging Face settings
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your token:
     ```
     HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here
     ```

## Running the Application

1. Ensure you're in the project directory with your virtual environment activated.

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the chatbot.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file that handles routing and API calls to Hugging Face
- `static/app.js`: JavaScript file for managing the chat interface
- `static/style.css`: CSS file for styling the chat interface
- `templates/base.html`: HTML template for the chat interface
- `.env`: Configuration file for storing the Hugging Face API token

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the Hugging Face API parameters in `app.py`. You can also change the model by updating the `API_URL` to use a different model from Hugging Face.

## Deployment

To deploy this application to a production environment:

1. Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS)
2. Set up the necessary environment variables, including your Hugging Face API token
3. Configure your server to run the Flask application
4. Ensure your server is set up with HTTPS for secure communication

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the chatbot are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

To run the application with these changes:

1. Sign up for a free account on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/).
2. Get your API token from the Hugging Face settings.
3. Add your Hugging Face API token to the `.env` file.
4. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```
5. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

This setup now uses the Hugging Face API instead of the OpenAI API. The chatbot will use the GPT-2 model to generate responses, which is available for free. You can adjust the model and parameters in the API call to customize the behavior of the chatbot.

Remember that while this API is free, it may have rate limits or usage restrictions. Always check the Hugging Face documentation for the most up-to-date information on usage limits and best practices.
